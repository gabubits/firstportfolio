# My first Portfolio

- This project was developed as a requirement for the selection process of the junior company Linked at UFSJ (Federal University of São João del-Rei).
- It was developed entirely with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.
- During the development of the project, components from Aceternity UI were used, a website that provides customizable components.
- Therefore, the React version adopted here is 18.3.1. Version 19.0.0 is not yet supported by Aceternity.

## Development process

- I have never done an entirely web project, although I know the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I have never applied them to a project.
- It was a very interesting journey of learning and mainly about taking risks. I was more comfortable with the data analysis activity, but I preferred to challenge myself with this activity.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
